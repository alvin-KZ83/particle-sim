# particle-sim
Simulation of particles following principles of differential growth and node addition.

## Project Overview
This project simulates particle dynamics inspired by differential growth, integrating a quadtree structure and vector field influence for a dynamic and interactive system.

## Key Components
- **Differential Growth**: Influences particle interactions and growth patterns.
- **Quadtree Structure**: Efficient spatial organization of particles.
- **Vector Field Influence**: Dictates particle movement and behaviors.

## Files
- `flow.js`: Vector field logic.
- `geohash.js`: Spatial data geohash functionalities.
- `path.js`: Path management and calculation.
- `point.js`: Point data structure definition.
- `qtree.js`: Quadtree implementation.
- `sketch.js`: Integration of components for simulation.

## Usage
Include all files in the project, initializing with `sketch.js`. Customize parameters for different behaviors and visuals.

## Applications
Ideal for educational use, visual arts, or as a basis for more complex simulations in graphics or natural phenomena modeling.
